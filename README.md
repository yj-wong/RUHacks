## Introduction 
While there are many solutions exist for environmental issues, they often exist in the form of small businesses and research teams that may not be well promoted. Our project is to build a platform where people can know about these efforts and support them. This is also a platform where people can donate and acquire waste/recyclable materials from others, as well as shop and sell their environmental-friendly products.
